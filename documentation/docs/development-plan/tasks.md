# Tasks
Below are sequential tasks with story points below each epic. It should be noted that we will complete story points from multiple different epics within a single sprint. These tasks represent a single demo-able feature that is associated with one or many story points. In general, the more story points, the more complex the task. Our task plan also considers risk, work complexity, and the amount of work new work versus repetition. Although these factors are difficult to nail down, based on our discussions with each other and requirements gathering, these are our best estimates. These estimates also consider that our group has varied experience building web applications; it is expected that collectively we will be using unfamiliar languages and database tools which proves to have a learning curve. The flow for our tasks is planning and prototyping, building out main pages, adding functionality to those pages, and then adding extra features if time permits.
