# Introduction

Tool Shed is a web application that was built to make it easier for people to buy and sell tools online. With many employees working from home and setting up home offices, Do It Yourself (DIY) projects are at an all-time high. Purchasing tools for a DIY project can be expensive if the tools are only used once or twice. Tool Shed makes it easy for users to search for and rent tools that they need for their DIY projects. With a few clicks, users can find the tool they need and rent it from someone in their local community.
