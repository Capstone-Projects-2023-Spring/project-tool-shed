# System Overview
## Project Abstract 

Tool Shed is a web-based application that will allow its users to rent, share, buy, sell, and trade tools of all kinds. Once users create Tool Shed accounts, they can list their own tools and equipment available to the community. Users will also be able to see what tools are available from members of the surrounding community. This web application is meant to be a low-cost solution for high-cost tools making them available at a fraction of the cost set by the owner.

## Conceptual Design 

The proposed web application will be developed using purely JavaScript. We chose to develop a web app, because it provides users with the convenience of accessing ToolShed from anywhere, at any time. We chose to use PostgreSQL as the database because it not only supports fulltext search out-of-the-box - it also has GIS extensions that can be used for geocoding addresses using census data, which is useful for placing addresses on maps so users can search for tools.

## Background 

With many employees working from home and setting up home offices, Do It Yourself (DIY) projects are at an all-time high. With internet resources and basic knowledge, you can get a significant amount of work done without hiring an expensive professional to complete the job. The alternative to purchasing an expensive tool for a few days of use could be renting the tool from someone in the local community that has the tool available and not in use. Users will profit from what is sitting in their tool shed while the items are not being used. This will help keep the cost low for DIY projects.
