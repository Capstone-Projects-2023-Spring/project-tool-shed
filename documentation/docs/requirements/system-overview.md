# System Overview
## Project Abstract 

Tool Shed is a web-based platform that aims to facilitate the rental, sharing, buying, selling, and trading of tools among its users. The platform will allow users to create accounts and list their tools, while also providing access to the tools available in the surrounding community. The objective of this low-cost solution is to make high-cost tools accessible to users at a fraction of the cost set by the owners.

## Conceptual Design 

The proposed web application will be developed using JavaScript, as it offers users the convenience of accessing Tool Shed from any location and at any time. PostgreSQL has been selected as the database for its support of fulltext search out-of-the-box, and its GIS extensions, which will enable geocoding addresses using census data. This feature will help place addresses on maps, allowing users to search for tools easily.

## Background 

With the growing trend of employees working from home and setting up home offices, there has been a surge in DIY projects. With the availability of internet resources and basic knowledge, individuals can undertake significant projects without incurring the cost of hiring professionals. Tool Shed provides an alternative to purchasing expensive tools, allowing users to rent tools from local community members who own the required equipment. By doing so, users can profit from the tools that would otherwise be sitting idle in their tool sheds. This, in turn, will keep the cost of DIY projects low.
