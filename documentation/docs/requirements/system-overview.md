# System Overview
## Project Abstract 

Tool Shed is a web-based application that will allow its users to share, buy, sell, and trade tools of all kinds. Once users are registered with Tool Shed accounts, they can list their own tools and equipment available to the community. Users will also be able to see what tools are available from members of the surrounding community. This web application is meant to be a low-cost solution for high-cost tools making them available at a fraction of the cost set by the owner. To plan for this project, our group is going to be researching programming languages and how to effectively use them for the scope of our project. The following languages will be fairly new to the majority of group members and will be researched during each sprint before development takes place... ReactJS, Express, Node, and PostgresSQL. In addition to the research our group will do on programming languages, we will also be using tools such as Jira, Miro, and Discord to collaborate and set up a guided plan for the development process. An example of this would be whiteboarding out the step-by-step process a user would take using the Tool Shed web app and using said information to support documentation, feed Jira tickets, and create a detailed feature and requirement list.

## Conceptual Design 

The proposed application will be developed using JavaScript, HTML, and other web technologies to ensure full functionality across multiple devices. The application will be hosted online through a web application, providing users with the convenience of accessing it from anywhere at any time. To enable data storage and retrieval, the application will be connected to a database that supports simple SQL commands. With this setup, users will be able to add and retrieve data seamlessly using SQL queries. The database will be designed with appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. By combining cutting-edge web technologies with a robust database, the application will provide users with a powerful tool to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. 

## Background 

With many employees working from home and setting up home offices, Do It Yourself (DIY) projects are at an all-time high. With internet resources and basic knowledge, you can get a significant amount of work done without hiring an expensive professional to complete the job. The alternative to purchasing an expensive tool for a few days of use could be renting the tool from someone in the local community that has the tool available and not in use. Users will profit from what is sitting in their tool shed while the items are not being used. This will help keep the cost low for DIY projects.
