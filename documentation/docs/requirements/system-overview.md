# System Overview
## Project Abstract 

Tool Shed is a web-based application that will allow its users to share, buy, sell, and trade tools of all kinds. Once users are registered with Tool Shed accounts, they can list their own tools and equipment available to the community. Users will also be able to see what tools are available from members of the surrounding community. This web application is meant to be a low-cost solution for high-cost tools making them available at a fraction of the cost set by the owner. 

Users will begin by registering online accounts using the Create Account option. After accounts are created, the user will manage tools they own and want to make available to the public by setting a daily rate and availability. Users will also be able to search the local community using keywords like, “Table saw,” or “Miter Saw,” and view low cost locally owned tools available. To help with their search, the user can filter their search results by type of tool and by mile radius. If the tool is unavailable at the time, the user can make a request to receive a notification when the tool is available. Once a tool is selected for either buy or rent, the users will be able to make a request with the owner of the tool and agree on a date and price. Users will be prompted to return the tool within an agreed window set by both users. 

For users who are looking to sell or lend their tools out to other users, they can select to list their tools. Afterwards, they are prompted to fill out information about their tools and upload images of them. The user receives a notification once another user requests their tool. 

 

## Conceptual Design 

The application will be programmed using JavaScript, HTML and hosted online via web application allowing full functionality on multiple devices. The application will be connected to a database allowing simple SQL commands to add/retrieve data. 

## Background 

With many employees working from home and setting up home offices, Do It Yourself (DIY) projects are at an all-time high. With internet resources and basic knowledge, you can get a significant amount of work done without hiring an expensive professional to complete the job. The alternative to purchasing an expensive tool for a few days of use could be renting the tool from someone in the local community that has the tool available and not in use. Users will profit from what is sitting in their tool shed while the items are not being used. This will help keep the cost low for DIY projects.
