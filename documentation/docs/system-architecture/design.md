# Design

## Class Diagram
For each component provide class diagrams showing the classes to be developed (or used) and their relationship.

## Components & Interfaces
A description the different components and their interfaces. For example: client, server, database.


## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #1
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #2
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #3
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #4
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #5
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Sequence Diagram - Use Case #6
Sequence diagrams showing the data flow for _all_ use cases. One sequence diagram corresponds to one use case and different use cases should have different corresponding sequence diagrams.

## Algorithms
Describe algorithms employed in your project, e.g. neural network paradigm, training and training data set, etc.
